# Go Course

A beginner-friendly Go course overview built from annotated snippets in `demo.go`.

## Contents

- `demo.go`: source file with lesson notes and examples
- `go-course.md`: cleaned, structured course summary

## How to Use

1. Read `go-course.md` for the guided overview.
2. Open `demo.go` to see the original snippet-by-snippet progression.
3. Uncomment examples in `demo.go` and run them as you learn.

## Run

```bash
go run demo.go
```

## Current Scope

The course currently covers data types, formatting, arithmetic and conversion rules, `math`, `strconv`, control flow, loop patterns, and string iteration (`byte`/`rune` behavior). Arrays are marked as the next topic.
